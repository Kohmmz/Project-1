        <h2>The history of Ugail</h2>
        <p style="font-size: larger;">Maize was introduced to Africa between the 16th and 17th centuries by the Portuguese, shortly after sorghum and millet were the main staple cereals. African farmers quickly adopted maize because it was easy to grow and produced higher yields than sorghum, eventually replacing it in most regions by the late 20th century. In Malawi, maize is so important that they say "chimanga ndi moyo" (maize is life). While maize is the primary ingredient for nshima/nsima, it can also be made from sorghum or cassava, the latter of which is especially common in lakeshore areas. When maize harvests are poor, cassava nsima becomes a widespread alternative across Malawi.</p>
